Asterisk-GUI Security
=====================

The login to the system must be a valid user in manager.conf who has
config permission in read/write. Please note that the Asterisk-GUI framework 
does not support subpermissions at this time, meaning that a user with config
permission may change ANY configuration file in ANY way
